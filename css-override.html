    <!-- Specificity -->
    <section>
        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <p>The specificity of a CSS selector determines which rule is applied when multiple rules could apply to the same element. The specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used.</p>
        <p>This paragraph is blue due to the element selector.</p>
        <p class="highlight">This paragraph is green due to the class selector.</p>
        <p id="unique" class="highlight">This paragraph is red due to the higher specificity of the ID selector.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Cascade -->
    <section class="example2">
        <h2>The Cascade</h2>
        <p>The cascade determines the final styles for an element by applying rules from various sources in a specific order. Rules are applied in the order they appear, with later rules overriding earlier ones if they have the same specificity.</p>
        <p>This paragraph is green because the later rule overrides the earlier one.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Inline Styles -->
    <section class="example3">
        <h2>Inline Styles</h2>
        <p>Inline styles have the highest specificity and will override any external or internal styles unless marked with <code>!important</code>.</p>
        <p style="color: green;">This paragraph is green because the inline style has the highest specificity.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- !important -->
    <section class="example4">
        <h2>!important</h2>
        <p>The <code>!important</code> declaration overrides any other rules, regardless of specificity. However, it should be used sparingly, as it makes code harder to maintain.</p>
        <p style="color: green;">This paragraph is blue because the <code>!important</code> rule overrides the inline style.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Inheritance -->
    <section class="example5">
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Some CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to child elements. If a property is not explicitly set on a child element, it will inherit the value from its parent.</p>
        <div>
            <p>This paragraph is blue because it inherits the color from the parent div.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
